        <h1>How i started to learn html</h1>
        <p>Here i want to share how i took my first steps in web developing and build my first page</p>
        <h2>First impression</h2>
        <p>At first HTML looked confusing, but then I realized it’s just a way to describe what’s on a web page.</p>
        <h2>What i learned</h2>
        <p>HTML builds the structure of a website. Later I’ll use CSS for style and JavaScript to make it dynamic.</p>
        <h2>More learning</h2>
